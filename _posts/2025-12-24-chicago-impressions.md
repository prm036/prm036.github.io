When I first moved to the U.S.—Chicago, to be exact—I knew things would feel different, but I didn’t realize how subtle that difference would be. It wasn’t the big, dramatic moments that caught me off guard, but the quiet, everyday details—the ones that sneak up on you between bus rides, coffee runs, and cold walks by the lake.

For me, **students smoking right on the campus** was jarring. Back in India, it’s something people do behind corners or off-campus—here, it’s just another day between classes.

Then there’s the **Chicago River**—I learned they literally reversed its flow. That small fact somehow captures the American audacity: “Why not just make the river flow the other way?” Sure, why not.

The people, though, are the opposite of the weather—**surprisingly warm**. Everyone greets you. Everyone. “How’s your day going?” they’ll ask with a wide grin, even if you’re just another person on the sidewalk. At first, I wondered if I’d met the friendliest city on Earth. Now I realize it’s just the American way—the small talk, the quick smile, and the subtle art of sounding genuinely interested while already walking away.

Then came the **tipping culture**. The mental math after every meal deserves its own course credit. Fifteen? Eighteen? Twenty percent? There’s no escaping it—not even with takeout.

**Food was another surprise.** Cow milk, beef, and pork are everywhere—sometimes literally in everything. And while I miss a good *paneer* roll, I’ve found comfort in new classics: the unapologetically heavy deep-dish pizza and the humble Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich.

But there are things that took getting used to—like how few people ride bikes or how **trust seems to be the backbone of daily life**. You can take a bus without anyone checking your pass, return items without interrogation, and leave packages at your door without them disappearing.

Oh, and the walls. The apartment walls here are thin enough to hear your neighbor’s Netflix choices. Privacy? A distant dream—or maybe just a luxury in the Midwest.
